# Runner_weather_status/CS50x Final project
#### Video Demo: [URL HERE](https://youtu.be/hpapp_bKx-o)
# Description:
This project is part of Harvard CS50's Introduction to Computer Science final project. Runner_weather_status is a dedicated application designed for runners, providing comprehensive information on weather conditions and air pollutant levels then suggests users on whether it is suitable to run outside based on their entered location with the use of Openweathermap API.
  
The key factors considered when assessing the weather status:
  - Temperature
  - humidity
  - feels_like (perceived temperature)
  - Air Quality Index (AQI)
  - precipitation
  - UV index
 
  ## User Benefits:
  By utilizing this web app, runners can greatly benefit in terms of their personal health during their running sessions. The app provides valuable climate data that is tailored to the specific effects it has on the runner's well-being. With this data, runners can plan and adjust their training accordingly based on the weather conditions to minimize injuries and potential health risks.
  
  
  ## Tech used:
  - Python (Flask)
  - JavaScript 
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Openweathermap API
  - TomTom API
  
# How to Install and Run the Project:

 ```
 ## API KEY
 instuction todo
  
# Future Features:
  - Get user's location automatically by using Geolocation API. Since, London was set as the default location in the curent version.
